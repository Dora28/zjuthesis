  abstract = {Prediction and optimisation of non-cavitating marine propeller noise at low frequency are important for design of submarine propellers that are required to operate in the non-cavitating condition. The low-frequency discrete- and broadband-spectrum forces of propellers have different generation mechanisms, and thus have not previously been studied within a unified framework. In this work, the strip method is applied to simultaneously predict and optimise these two forces. First, the panel method is applied to predict the discrete-spectrum forces of different strips in the time domain. Then, the unsteady force of the whole propeller is obtained as the linear superposition of the shifted unsteady forces of all the strips, according to a skew distribution. The strip method is then used to numerically solve an integral equation for the broadband-spectrum force, derived via the spectral method. On the basis of experimental results, the predictions of low-frequency discrete- and broadband-spectrum forces are verified to have high accuracies. An analysis of the effect of propeller skew on the unsteady forces of different strips, and the effect of strip-cutting strategy on the broadband-spectrum force, is also performed. It is found that the skew of a strip is approximately equal to the angle of the circumferential phase shift of the unsteady force of that strip, and that the strip-cutting method has an insignificant effect on the predicted broadband-spectrum force. The optimisation of propeller performance under several constraints is then considered, with the particular objectives of maximising the propulsion efficiency and minimising the low-frequency discrete- and broadband-spectrum forces. The circumferential phase-shift effect of the skew allows the optimisation model to be decoupled into two steps. The discrete-spectrum force of the whole propeller can thus be computed using linear superposition rather than a hydrodynamic calculation, which significantly improves the computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the optimisation is verified by two optimization cases. For HSP, the propulsion efficiency is increased by 2.5\%, the broadband-spectrum noise is reduced by approximately 0.6 dB, and the first- and second-order values of discrete-spectrum thrust are decreased by 9\% and 27\%, respectively. Similarly, for E1619, the first- and second-order values of the discrete-spectrum thrust are reduced by 13\% and 18\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {A numerical approach for predicting tonal aerodynamic noise from “open rotors” is presented. “Open rotor” refers to an engine architecture with a pair of counter-rotating propellers. Typical noise spectra from an open rotor consist of dominant tones, which arise due to both the steady loading/thickness and the aerodynamic interaction between the two bladerows. The proposed prediction approach utilizes Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to obtain near-field description of the noise sources. The near-to-far-field propagation is then carried out by solving the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings equation. Since the interest of this paper is limited to tone noise, a linearized, frequency domain approach is adopted to solve the wake/vortex–blade interaction problem. This paper focuses primarily on the speed scaling of the aerodynamic tonal noise from open rotors. Even though there is no theoretical mode cut-off due to the absence of nacelle in open rotors, the far-field noise is a strong function of the azimuthal mode order. While the steady loading/thickness noise has circumferential modes of high order, due to the relatively large number of blades (≈10–12), the interaction noise typically has modes of small orders. The high mode orders have very low radiation efficiency and exhibit very strong scaling with Mach number, while the low mode orders show a relatively weaker scaling. The prediction approach is able to capture the speed scaling (observed in experiment) of the overall aerodynamic noise very well.},

  abstract = {The wide range use of marine equipment has greatly increased the underwater radiated noise (URN) level, creating more threat to marine life. Autonomous underwater vehicle is one of the solutions to reduce the use of large marine equipment and then decrease the noise. Aiming at the noise control of AUV, this study conducted a far field noise measurement experiment on an AUV working on 10 different conditions, which is rarely measured. The hybrid method, predicting the noise with Lighthill equation based on unsteady flow field data from CFD calculation, is adopted. The results from experiment and simulation indicates that the simulative results are in good agreements with experimental results and the propeller will still generate noise due to the irregular vibration of the propeller, which is about 3–5~dB. With the occurrence of cavitation, the sound pressure level (SPL) increases sharply, and there will be a wide gap between experimental and simulative noise data, owing to the single phase considered in the Lighthill equation. The analysis of the experimental and simulative results highlights the existence of structure excitation noise, ranging from 300 to 500~Hz and the shortcoming of noise prediction of the hybrid method under cavitation stage.},

In this work, pump-jet propulsion with a DARPA Suboff submarine was taken as the investigated object. The trailing edge of its duct was transformed with some serrations, and its noise reduction effect was studied. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method was utilized to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump-jet propulsion. Then the FW-H acoustic model was added into the noise performance simulation after the flow stabilization. After the installation of the serrated trailing edge, the propulsion Sound Pressure Level (SPL) changes were observed. According to the contributions of different parts to the noise intensity and the vortex field changes, the noise reduction effect was analyzed. The results indicate that not only the propulsion noise radiation but also the noise reduction effect is directional. Due to the larger noise contribution of the duct, the serrated trailing edge has a better effect in the radial direction. In addition,the circumferential correlation of the duct vortex is broken by the serrations, the large vortices are divided into several small ones, and the vortex diffusion is accelerated.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the vibration analysis of rotating machine signals is a well-established methodology, rooted on powerful tools offered, in particular, by the theory of cyclostationary (CS) processes. Among them, the squared envelope spectrum (SES) is probably the most popular to detect random CS components which are typical symptoms, for instance, of rolling element bearing faults. Recent researches are shifted towards the extension of existing CS tools – originally devised in constant speed conditions – to the case of variable speed conditions. Many of these works combine the SES with computed order tracking after some preprocessing steps. The principal object of this paper is to organize these dispersed researches into a structured comprehensive framework. Three original features are furnished. First, a model of rotating machine signals is introduced which sheds light on the various components to be expected in the SES. Second, a critical comparison is made of three sophisticated methods, namely, the improved synchronous average, the cepstrum prewhitening, and the generalized synchronous average, used for suppressing the deterministic part. Also, a general envelope enhancement methodology which combines the latter two techniques with a time-domain filtering operation is revisited. All theoretical findings are experimentally validated on simulated and real-world vibration signals.},

Specifically, it points out the similarities, differences and potential pitfalls associated with cyclic spectral analysis as opposed to classical spectral analysis. It is shown that non-parametric cyclic spectral estimators can all be derived from a general quadratic form, which yields as particular cases “cyclic” versions of the smoothed, averaged, and multitaper periodograms. The performance of these estimators is investigated in detail on the basis of their frequency resolution, cyclic leakage, systematic and stochastic estimation errors. The results are then extended to more advanced spectral quantities such as the cyclic coherence function and the Wigner–Ville spectrum of CS signals. In particular an optimal estimator of the Wigner–Ville spectrum is found, with remarkable properties. Several examples of cyclic spectral analyses, with an emphasis on mechanical systems, are finally presented in order to illustrate the value of such a general treatment for practical applications.},

The objective is to demonstrate that machine signals require specific processing that are much more subtle than for communication signals—from which the paradigm of cyclostationarity was originally issued from and developed for. First, different types of cyclostationarity embracing a multitude of rotating machine signals are distinguished. In particular, the importance of considering pure rather than impure cyclostationarity is stressed out. Next, the relationships between angle and time cyclostationarity are investigated and some useful results are derived. It is shown that vibration signals exhibit cyclostationarity if and only if the random speed fluctuation of the machine is periodic, stationary or cyclostationary. Finally, a comprehensive methodology is proposed for processing actual cyclostationary signals: three typical examples dealing with vibration signals of an IC engine, a gearbox and a rolling element bearing are presented, each of them being characterised by a different type of cyclostationarity. The methodology proposed in this paper is general enough and may serve as a guideline for modelling and analysing other types of rotating machine signals, such as pressure signals, electric signals, etc.},

Pursuing along similar lines, the paper proposes a new statistical test based on the recently introduced cyclic modulation coherence (CMC), which is close to optimal in detecting cyclostationary noise, while at the same time being easy and extremely fast to compute. Detection capability is thoroughly investigated as a function of the blade pass frequency and other parameter settings. Finally, the cyclostationarity framework makes possible the proposal of a closed-form statistical threshold that opens the way to automatic detection.},

The Cyclic Modulation Spectrum (the Fourier transform of the spectrogram) stands as a much faster alternative, yet it suffers from the uncertainty principle and is thus limited to detect relatively slow periodic modulations. This paper fixes the situation by proposing a new fast estimator of the spectral correlation, the Fast Spectral Correlation, based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). It proceeds from the property that, for a cyclostationary signal, the STFT evidences periodic flows of energy in and across its frequency bins. The Fourier transform of the interactions of the STFT coefficients then returns a quantity which scans the Spectral Correlation along its cyclic frequency axis. The gain in computational cost as compared to the conventional estimator is like the ratio of the signal length to the STFT window length and can therefore be considerable. The validity of the proposed estimator is demonstrated on non trivial vibration signals (very weak bearing signatures and speed varying cases) and its computational advantage is used to compute a new quantity, the Enhanced Envelope Spectrum.},

  abstract = {The second order Cyclostationarity Analysis (CA) is gaining attention for detection and classification of marine vehicles driven by propellers in broadband passive sonar systems, in which the Detection of Envelope Modulation On Noise (DEMON) is a standard tool for the same purpose. In this paper both CA and DEMON are discussed in the form of discrete digital formulae. It is shown that the three cyclo-spectra obtained by the DEMON analysis, the coherent integration of the Cyclic Modulation Spectra (CMS) and the coherent integration of the Cyclic Modulation Coherence (CMC) are equivalent to each other when the same frequency band and duration are chosen for calculating all of them. This equivalence is further explained based on the physical characteristic of cyclic modulation (also called amplitude modulation), that is, the same harmonic of cyclic modulation at different carrier frequencies is in-phase. For detection and/or classification of propeller signals a Coherent Integration and Quadratic Detection Law (CIQDL) is proposed to construct cyclo-spectra from the CMS and CMC. The performance of the thus constructed cyclo-spectra are compared with that of cyclo-spectra constructed using the Quadratic Detection Law (QDL). The SNR gain of the CIQDL over the QDL is derived theoretically and the gain is always larger than unity, indicating that the CIQDL outperforms the QDL. Both simulation and seatrial data are used to demonstrate the in-phase characteristic. The performances of the CIQDL and the QDL are also quantitatively assessed using both simulation and sea-trial data. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {As the blades of a propeller pass through the water they produce characteristic amplitude modulated random noise signals which can be detected using sonar. It has recently been shown that the cyclostationary properties of this signal can be exploited to detect the presence of the propeller craft in significant extraneous noise. A detection technique based on the Cyclic Modulation Spectrum was shown to offer advantages over existing detection techniques in that no user interaction was required to design band pass filters, and superior frequency resolution was available to more accurately identify shaft and propeller pass frequencies. This technique has subsequently been developed to further exploit the cyclostationary properties of the signal by designing statistical thresholds which support automatic detection. This paper provides an overview of the progress of the cyclostationary detection work presented to date, and introduces a further development: exploiting cyclostationarity to determine the range, heading and speed of the surface ship. This concept is based on array processing using the cyclic autocorrelation function. The performance of this technique is demonstrated using simulation and the work is placed in the context of an overall detection and identification framework.},

  abstract = {This tutorial is intended to guide the reader in the diagnostic analysis of acceleration signals from rolling element bearings, in particular in the presence of strong masking signals from other machine components such as gears. Rather than being a review of all the current literature on bearing diagnostics, its purpose is to explain the background for a very powerful procedure which is successful in the majority of cases. The latter contention is illustrated by the application to a number of very different case histories, from very low speed to very high speed machines. The specific characteristics of rolling element bearing signals are explained in great detail, in particular the fact that they are not periodic, but stochastic, a fact which allows them to be separated from deterministic signals such as from gears. They can be modelled as cyclostationary for some purposes, but are in fact not strictly cyclostationary (at least for localised defects) so the term pseudo-cyclostationary has been coined. An appendix on cyclostationarity is included. A number of techniques are described for the separation, of which the discrete/random separation (DRS) method is usually most efficient. This sometimes requires the effects of small speed fluctuations to be removed in advance, which can be achieved by order tracking, and so this topic is also amplified in an appendix. Signals from localised faults in bearings are impulsive, at least at the source, so techniques are described to identify the frequency bands in which this impulsivity is most marked, using spectral kurtosis. For very high speed bearings, the impulse responses elicited by the sharp impacts in the bearings may have a comparable length to their separation, and the minimum entropy deconvolution technique may be found useful to remove the smearing effects of the (unknown) transmission path. The final diagnosis is based on “envelope analysis” of the optimally filtered signal, but despite the fact that this technique has been used for 40 years in analogue form, the advantages of more recent digital implementations are explained.},

Generally, passive underwater acoustic detection is accomplished by processing the radiated noise of a marine’s propeller. This study proposes a robust passive underwater acoustic detection method of a propeller by combining cyclostationary mechanism and principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed method can extract the characteristic frequency information of a propeller accurately. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified according to simulated signals and real application cases. Both monocomponent and multicomponent modulated simulated signals are used to test the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method is then applied to the acoustic signals of propeller experiments and merchant ship propeller. Finally, the superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the application results with the kurtogram and cyclostationary analysis method, during the extraction of the characteristic frequency of the propeller under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The innovation of the proposed method not only realizes marine propeller detection from propeller acoustic signals but also has remarkable performance under low SNR.},

All hydrodynamic noises are predicted by using Lighthill's acoustic analogy method, and their variation characteristics along the axial and transverse directions, the radiation directivity and the sound energy are all investigated. It shows that the radiation laws of each kind of noise in the transverse direction have good symmetry about the underwater vehicle. The noise energy in the transverse direction is stronger than the axial in the transverse direction, and decreases with increasing distance deviating from the underwater vehicle. The main energy of the flow induced-noise of the shell is distributed near the wings, while others are near the middle, the propellers, and first half of the underwater vehicle, respectively. The noise energy increases with the increase of the forward speed of the vehicle. A comprehensive analysis of the hydrodynamic noise of the underwater vehicle is also made. It shows that the hydrodynamic noise induced by the shell is the major noise at low speed, and the hydrodynamic noise induced by the propellers will dominate the whole noise with the increase of speed. The total hydrodynamic noise increases with the increase of the speed and is proportional to the square of the speed.},

LCF is defined by repetitive cycling in a low stress and a short period. The vibration response of material subjected to LCF provides information linked to the solicitation and to the fatigue damage. Thus, we considered a cantilever beam with breathing cracks and assumed that under the solicitation, breathing cracks generates non-linearity in the stiffness of the material and this one decreases with the damage. We used the second-order of the cyclostationarity to reveal this non-linearity and showed that the fatigue provide a random component in the signal, which increases with the fatigue damage. Thus, in the specific case of a material subjected to LCF, with a non-linear stiffness, we propose a new methodology to detect and diagnose the fatigue damage using a vibration signal. This methodology is based on the second order of the cyclostationarity.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a reliable method for target vessel identification in passive sonar by exploiting the underlying periodicity of propeller noise signal, using the principles of cyclostationarity. In conventional signal processing methods, random signals are treated as statistically stationary and the parameters of the underlying physical mechanism that generates the signal would not vary in time. However, for most manmade signals, some parameters vary periodically with time and this requires that random signals be modeled as cyclostationary. In the field of sonar, the propeller noise signal generated by underwater vessels is cyclostationary. As a ship propagates in the sea, noise generated during the collapse of cavitation-induced bubbles are modulated by the rotating propeller shaft and this results in characteristic amplitude modulated random noise signal, which can be detected using passive sonar. Processing these signals, the number of blades and the shaft frequency of the propeller can be identified. In this work, cyclostationary processing technique is introduced for processing propeller noise signal and it is observed to provide better noise immunity. A detailed comparison with the conventional DEMON processing is also presented. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Ships with low noise characteristics will be a must in the near future for almost all ship types. However for special ships, such as naval surface vessels, fishing vessels, submarines, etc. this has already been an issue because of their operational requirements. The propeller is one of the main sources of underwater noise generated by ships. Therefore, it is important to predict and control the underwater noise characteristics of propellers. In this respect, the main objective of this study is to calculate propeller radiated noise numerically. Propeller noise has been investigated numerically for the INSEAN E1619 submarine propeller in open water, behind a generic DARPA suboff submarine and within imposed wake cases at non-cavitating conditions due to their deeply submerged operations. Flow around the propeller is solved with a commercial CFD software using Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS), while hydro-acoustic analysis is performed using a model based on Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equation. This paper reports the results of the study. The paper also includes the details of the bodies and discusses further improvement of the methodology applied.},

  abstract = {泵喷推进器是近年来发展起来的一种推进器,具有推进效率高,辐射噪声低,临界航速高的优点。由于这些优点,越来越多的水下航行器上开始使用这种推进器,尤其是核动力潜艇和高速鱼雷上,这些为泵喷推进器的研究提供了必要。 	随着CFD理论和数值技术的大力发展,为泵喷推进器的性能预报提供了重要研究手段。本文采用FLUENT流体力学商用计算软件对泵喷推进器的定常和非定常性能进行数值预报。 	首先,采用MRF方法分别对DTMB P4119螺旋桨、Ka4-5512+No.19A和Ka4-7008+JD7704导管螺旋桨定常水动力性能进行数值预报,通过与实验结果的对比,验证了本文所采用的网格技术和CFD数值计...},
